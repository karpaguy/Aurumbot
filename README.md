<h2 text-align: center><i> Before continuing, it is imperative that you read the "Money Farming - Arumtails and Monster Bells - 430k per hour" at the Steam Community (Link below). </i></h3>

<p><strong> Three more things: </strong></p>
<p>    • Your game combat speed must be set to 3x.
    <br>
       • You must have at least one Arumtail with Gemstone Barrage as the first in your team.
    <br>
       • You don't need all of your Arumtails fully-equiped, only the lightshifted with your best equipament can do the job (this is a tip).
