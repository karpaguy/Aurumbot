<p><strong> Three more things: </strong></p>
<p>    • Your game combat speed must be set to 3x.
    <br>
       • You must have a Arumtail with Gemstone Barrage as the first in your team.
    <br>
       • You don't need all of your Arumtails fully-equiped, only the lightshifted with your best equipament can do the job (this is a tip).

<p><strong>:question: • WHAT IS THIS BOT DESIGNED FOR? </strong></p>
<p> This bot is designed for those that want to farm money and eggs in Monster Sanctuary, using Arumtails to kill Blade Widows repeatedly. Just open the game, be at the right place, with your Aurumtail team, start the bot and go do something else, when you return, there will be a bunch of gold and eggs on your character. </p>
<br></br>
<p><strong>:question: • WHAT SHOULD I DO TO WORK? </strong></p>
<p> Simple, just go to the place stated in the guide to farm Blade Widows and start the exe. After the cmd opens, click on your game screen and let it there, don't change the screen until you're satisfied with the farming. Just let the bot works and go do something else.
<br></br>
<p><strong>:question: • HOW DOES IT WORK? </strong></p>
<p> The bot starts locating where is a "Monster Ball" in your inventory, then it starts searching for Blade Widows in the screen, when located, it will walk to it and start the battle. The Aurumbot is maded to use only Gemstone Barrage, so it will kill all enemies on screen and procede. Since there will be enemies detected on the screen, the bot will use a Monster Ball to respawn the Widows and repeat all the process. <p>

<p><strong>:space_invader: KNOW ISSUES </strong></p>
    <p>  • If your monster bell is not on the first "list" (the item icon is gray), the bot will fail.
        <br>
         • Sometimes the bot doesn't recognize a Blade Widow on screen and wastes a monster bell.
    </p>
 <br>
<p><strong>:dizzy: NEXT FEATURES </strong></p>
     <p>  • Be able to input how much monster bell you want to use.
        <br>
          • Auto-donate farmed eggs.
    <br>
